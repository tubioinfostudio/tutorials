    "We are passing our function a number, an `int`, and determining if that number has a remainder of 0 when we use the modulo operator on it. If the remainder is 0 then we return `True`, otherwise we return `False`. This is really as complicated as it needs to get with functions. You can make them extremely crazy, or you can make them very simple. They are best used when you find yourself copying and pasting a lot of code. If you have a list of numbers and you want to  check every one of them to see if they are even or not, this function will work just fine! Try to write that out on your own and see what you come up with. Keep in mind, when you return more than one thing, it becomes a `tuple`, and you have  to index accordingly."
